      "description": "Meet Vaiana — our Volkswagen T4 TDI. Compact, nimble, and incredibly easy to drive — as zippy as a car, perfect even if you're new to the van world. No experience needed: Vaiana takes you everywhere with lightness and simplicity. Inside you'll find everything you need for life on four wheels: a functional kitchen with two burners, sink and fridge, a comfy double bed on the lower level, and a second large double bed in the pop-up roof tent — where you fall asleep watching the stars. Approved for four travellers to ride and sleep, making it ideal for couples, friends or small families. Rounding it out: a portable chemical toilet (PortaPotti), an outdoor shower to refresh surrounded by nature, a bike rack for those who love exploring on two wheels, and electrical outlets to charge phones, laptops and devices even when completely off-grid. Vaiana isn't just a van — it's a lifestyle: essential, authentic, wild. Built for those who want to slow down, break the routine and breathe freedom with every fibre. If you feel the call of adventure and want to spend your days outdoors, on back roads, with breakfasts with a view and sunsets that warm the soul… Vaiana is waiting for you."

      "description": "Meet Tarifa — a compact yet spacious Fiat Ducato that's easy to drive and equipped with everything you need to feel free… but also at home. Tarifa is the perfect choice for those seeking comfort and autonomy without giving up the simplicity of life on the road. The backup camera makes every manoeuvre easy, while the driving is smooth and intuitive — even for first-time vanners. Inside you'll find a bright, elegant space that welcomes you warmly. The living area is roomy and functional, with a comfortable table for eating, working or relaxing. The kitchen is equipped with two burners for cooking in freedom, and the bathroom — surprisingly spacious for a van this size — gives you a real hot shower just like home. In the evening, the dinette converts into a large bed sleeping two (or even three), and an optional third bed is available in the cabin on request. Hot water, heating in the living area and air conditioning in the cabin make every season perfect for hitting the road. Tarifa is approved for three travellers but designed for those who love feeling at home everywhere. Whether you want to lose yourself among the Dolomite peaks or wake up by the sea, Tarifa is ready to follow you. For those who dream of a journey made of freedom, nature and sunsets to remember. With Tarifa, every road can become home."
